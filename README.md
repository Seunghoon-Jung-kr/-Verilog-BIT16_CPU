# Overview

"This is a personal project where I designed a 16-bit CPU with a set of 25 instructions introduced in M. Morris Mano's book, Computer System Architecture, using Verilog."

# Purpose of this project

"I created this project to deepen my understanding of computer architecture, digital logic circuits, and Verilog HDL."

# More Detail

"I wanted to try both behavioral and dataflow modeling in Verilog, so I applied behavioral modeling to large-scale modules like the system bus, while using dataflow modeling for smaller modules like register modules, where I derived Boolean functions from block diagrams, truth tables, and Karnaugh maps."

# Design objective

"I primarily focused on making the designed CPU work as intended. For this reason, although there were several imperfections, parts that needed improvement, or features I wanted to add, I chose to prioritize achieving the set objective."

# Design method

"I basically used a top-down design methodology, employing elements like the control unit, registers, multiplexers, and the ALU, while also incorporating a partial bottom-up approach by designing each component starting from the smallest elements. Additionally, while designing some registers, I created circuit diagrams on paper and translated them into dataflow modeling, which may make the code feel somewhat less user-friendly. I uploaded a few images for reference."


# IDE

"I designed it using Vivado."
