# Overview

"This is a personal project where I designed a 16-bit CPU with a set of 25 instructions introduced in M. Morris Mano's book, Computer System Architecture, using Verilog."

# Purpose of this project

"I created this project to deepen my understanding of computer architecture, digital logic circuits, and Verilog HDL."

# More Detail

"I wanted to try both behavioral and dataflow modeling in Verilog, so I applied behavioral modeling to large-scale modules like the system bus, while using dataflow modeling for smaller modules like register modules, where I derived Boolean functions from block diagrams, truth tables, and Karnaugh maps."

# Design objective

"My objective was to design a low-power CPU capable of executing the given instruction set using the von Neumann architecture. To achieve this, I implemented partial power gating in the ALU circuit and the increment circuit within the registers. Besides that, I just focused on making the CPU run. Furthermore, I designed it under the assumption that the main memory would use IP, so the 'RAM.v' file in the code list is intended only for simulation purposes. And apart from that I designed all arithmetic logic circuits using a carry lookahead adder."

# Design method

"I basically used a top-down design method, using submodules like the control unit, registers, multiplexers, and the ALU, while also including a partial bottom-up approach by designing each component starting from the smallest elements. Additionally, while designing some registers, I created circuit diagrams on paper and converted them into dataflow modeling, which may make the code feel somewhat less user-friendly. So, I uploaded an image for reference."

# IDE

"I designed and tested it using only Vivado."
